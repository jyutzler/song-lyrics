## Mask

    Sometimes things don't unfold like you wanted
    Has nothing to do with anything haunted
    When the prism met the full moonlight
    Things didn't quite turn out alright
    What I thought was a vision was only a dream
    Things aren't always what they seem
    Behind the superficial shadows of your darkened eyes
    The answer to your timid hiding lies
    What are you hiding from, what's there to fear?
    Only the apprehension of what you'll find here

    Why would you never want to step out into the world without your makeup?
    What could you possibly want to hide behind your darkened eyes?
    It's only a mask to disguise you as grown-up
    Leave it to me to reach behind those unneeded tries

-

    You'd better be careful who you blow off
    Why befriend someone as fake as yourself
    Stop fucking around and go to the next level
    Or run around in circles as worthless people do
    Don't you want to make your life better?
    To put an end to the trend to mediocrity?
    I only do what I think is right
    What's the drive for you to be so introverted?
    When it's obvious you don't give a fuck
    What the strongest of minds think of you
    Just because I don't agree with you
    In every little thing

    Sometimes things don't unfold like you wanted
    Has nothing to do with anything haunted
    When the prism met the full moonlight
    Things didn't quite turn out alright
    Because when I looked into your eyes
    Beyond the cheesy waves and hi's
    I found the mirror always lies
    But there is still a way for you to rise
    I wish it were not too much to ask
    But let me in behind the mask
