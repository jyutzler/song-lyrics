## Picture

    I see you've got something to show me
    To you it's clear as day
    To you it is so obvious
    But I'm looking at the picture from the side
    Looking at the picture from the side
    I do not understand
    Because I'm looking at the picture from the side
    
    I see you're getting frustrated
    We don't see eye to eye
    I know you want to push me out the door
    But I'm looking at the picture from the side
    Looking at the picture from the side
    I do not understand
    Because I'm looking at the picture from the side
    
    Show me we're on the same team
    Show me we're trying to do right
    Together we will find the way ahead
    And get that picture turned right
    Together we'll get that picture turned right
    Together we will understand
    And get that dang picture turned right
