Who do you trust?<br>Do you know?<br>Your family?<br>The latest date?<br>Best friend,<br>Manager?<br>New dude in the band?| Are you confused?<br/>Join the club<br/>Can you explain?<br/>Account for pain?<br/>Describe yourself?<br/>Understand me?<br/>Anything to tell?
Find out<br/>What have you got<br/>Without a friend<br/>It's you against the world<br/>Fat chance<br/>Do you trust yourself?<br/>Friends will help you|Slaved by feelings<br/>Can't let it out?<br/>← Look to your left<br/>← Is that all you got?<br/>Fat chance<br/>Feel better now?<br/>← Now look to your left!
Learn who they are<br/>It's the only way<br/>I have always been here<br/>You can trust me<br/>Now you know<br/>Make use of potential<br/>That's what it's there for|Pick a topic<br/>That you can't explain<br/>A strange emotion<br/>A new experience<br/>A major screwup<br/>Now how do I feel?<br/>We share a lot.
    
    Listen to me.
