## Truth

<pre>
I feel gratitude for the most inconsequential things
Or is it the consequence that overthinking brings
<b>Just being who you are brings brightness to my day</b>
Can one be too thankful in an unnatural way?

<i>I can monopolize your time in a way that is not fair
I can go too far to demonstrate, to show you that I care
Sometimes I will absolutely dare...</i>

I don't need to be here; there's no problem that I solve
Just get me out of the room and let the situation evolve
<b>Making my problems your problems is the last thing I want to do</b>
I would rather crash my car than keep this sentiment from you

<i>I live my life in fear I have or I will do you wrong
This will probably come to a head before too long
This song is already too long...</i>

I can't talk about this with you...
I can't talk about this with anyone else...

I can stand here with my clipboard and tell you what to do
But it's not very likely to have the effect I want it to
<b>It's not enough to make my point; it's not enough to give proof</b>
I have to trust you to work it out and that my friend's the truth
</pre>
