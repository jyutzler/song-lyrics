## Fast Falcon

#### Chorus

    Fast falcon (X3)
    Flying through the sandy desert

---------

    Wind rustling
    Looking around
    Searching for food
    Rodent found

_chorus_

    Chasing fast
    Rodent running
    Rodent lost
    Feeling sorry
    
_chorus_

    Getting darker
    Sky going
    Flying faster
    Not knowing

_chorus_

    Hear a sound
    Yummy snack
    Hopeful now
    Time to attack

----------

_Rodent thinks he's safe_

_And falls into the trap_

_Fast falcon...Zap!_

----------

    Fast falcon (X3)
    Landing safely
    Food in talon
