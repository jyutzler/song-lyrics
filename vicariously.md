## Vicariously

    I see you and your husband and you are eight months pregnant
    And I see you're filled with so much excitement
    And I live vicariously through you
    Live vicariously through you (X3)
    But I'm happy for you
    Live vicariously through you (X4)
    
    I see you and your family and life, life's so perfect
    And I see you're filled with so much excitement
    And I live vicariously through you
    Live vicariously through you (X3)
    But I'm happy for you
    Live vicariously through you (X4)
    
    Just understand that I might be a bit frustrated
    My life's at a point where I probably can't have these things...
    ...That's alright because I
    Live vicariously through you (X3)
    But I'm happy for you
    Live vicariously through you (X4)
    
    All I can do is live my life my own way
    And hope that some day I'll fill you with so much excitement
    And you'll live vicariously through me
    Live vicariously through me (X3)
    Are you happy for me?
    Live vicariously through me
    Live vicariously through you
    Live vicariously through me
    Live vicariously through you
