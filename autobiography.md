## Autobiography

<pre>
I was born in '73 <b>but</b> 
I don't like to stress my life in childhood
  At thirteen I had hardly the life you want <b>but</b>
  At forty-nine I was the one we all looked up to

  Some people know what it means to have a great time <b>but</b>
I know <b>awareness</b>
  Some people know how great it feels to be on top <b>but</b>
I know they're not laughing to themselves now

I am jealous of those who make fun of me
I am intimidated by the power they portray <b>but yet</b>
I do not envy their lifestyles one bit
