## Autobiography

<pre>
<b>I</b> was born in '73 <b>but</b> 
<b>I</b> don't like to stress my life in childhood
  At thirteen I had hardly the life you want <b>but</b>
  At forty-nine I was the one we all looked up to

  Some people know what it means to have a great time <b>but</b>
<b>I</b> know <b>awareness</b>
  Some people know how great it feels to be on top <b>but</b>
<b>I</b> know they're not laughing to themselves now

<b>I</b> am jealous of those who make fun of me
<b>I</b> am intimidated by the power they portray <b>but yet</b>
<b>I</b> do not envy their lifestyles one bit

<b>I</b> have know what it is like to be alone <b>but</b>
<b>I</b> have refused to let it stay that way
  At twenty I was a complete unknown
  At thirty-eight they could not find me enough
  At forty-nine I was giving my acceptance speech
  
<b>I</b> drank from the remains of those
  Who knew not of my intentions
<b>I</b> would never let it be known
  Who was being used
  
<b>I</b> earned my <b>respect</b> by <b>respecting</b> the respectable ones

<b>I</b> lied every once in a while
  When the truth could have hurt all of us
  Most people, thank God, never knew the difference

<b>I</b> have slept at times <b>but</b>
<b>I</b> am always awake
  To the life and times of my truest of friends
<b>I</b> am not the type to hurt my truest of friends <b>but</b>
<b>I</b> am not sure why someone would do that anyway
  How could someone do that to a friend?

<b>But</b> there was still that other type
  The type that truly hated me
  Who wanted to destroy me
  Whose talk was more than hype

These are the ones I feared the most
They have the power to reach their goals
They will...
They will stop at nothing to wreck my life

In 2011 They tried to tell me <b>I</b> was done
        <b>I</b> could not tell you where they were coming from
        Nor could <b>I</b> be phased by this at all
        
In 2010 I was playing drums in a band
In 2012 I was having my arms amputated

<b>I</b> worked to get the pieces to fit
At forty-nine <b>I</b> was giving my acceptance speech
<b>I</b> wallowed in this founded fame

<b>I</b> never thought I was immortal
Nor did <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> would die a normal death
But if today <b>I</b> live with artificial limbs
<b>I</b> can say <b>I</b>'ve never been permanently hurt

Who knows...
Who will try to hurt me again
<b>I</b> know...
<b>I</b> will be okay
<b>I</b> know...
<b>I</b> will be all right
