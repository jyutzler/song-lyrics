## I Don't Know (But I Wanna Find Out)

<pre>
It's all so confusing
We could go in any direction
What's it gonna be?
I don't know but I wanna find out (X3)

You know you don't feel comfortable
That's no surprise, neither do I
Can we make it work?
I don't know but I wanna find out (X3)

<i>It's getting hot in here
Can someone open a window?
I can barely breathe</i>

Let's go, go for a walk
If I reach my hand towards yours
What is gonna happen?
I don't know but I wanna find out (X3)

What's it like on the other side?
I don't know but I wanna find out

How do you do that thing you do?
I don't know but I wanna find out

Can we find some common ground?
I don't know but I wanna find out

Can we learn to love our neighbor?
I don't know but I wanna find out (X3)
