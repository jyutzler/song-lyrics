## Rain on the Leaf

    Rain on the leaf
    When the springs go
    And then the spring comes back when the snow melts
    And Miles on my team will remember me
    When the flowers grow
    It rains on a leaf
    Everything is so

    There's a tune in my head with a song on it
    I followed the song
    The song played by itself

    It snows and then it melts on the garden
    Thank you
    Thank you
    Take a bow
