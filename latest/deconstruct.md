## Deconstruct My Psyche

#### _Chorus_

    I have to deconstruct my psyche
    I have to do whatever it takes
    Finding myself is the hardest part
    When I don't have faith
    And I don't know how to love
    And I am the sum of my mistakes

------------------
    
    This is all a crazy trip
    What does it mean to have a grip?
    Delusions I can have it all
    The higher the peak the bigger the fall
    The illusion that any of it matters
    
_chorus_

    I was walking in the darkness
    Until I ran into a wall
    There was someone on the other side
    No use tryin' to find a place to hide
    It was time for me to make a call
    
-------------------------
    
    This is going to be a mistake
    There is no reason for me to catch a break
    I have to do it anyway, have to give myself a chance
    To find joy, or is it pleasure

------------------------

_chorus_
    
    I have to do many difficult things
    To leave a legacy beyond grasping for rings
    Understand everything that's going on
    Including things that I can't control
    To be the best man that I can
    
_chorus_
