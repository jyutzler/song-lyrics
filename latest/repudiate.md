## Did Not Repudiate

    It's not like they didn't like it
    Maybe they wanted some more time
    It's all about getting it right
    They did not repudiate
 
    I liked it more than I can ever say
    It felt so warm, so sweet
    I could not fill that role but
    I did not repudiate
 
    It's not like I knew what I wanted
    I just wanted to find out
    In a blink I had my answer but
    She did not repudiate
 
    Here in the bridge we're building a bridge
    We did not repudiate
    We're all comfortable with each other
    We did not repudiate
    Whatever happens next
    We did not repudiate
    We're all thankful
    We did not repudiate
    We did not repudiate
    We did not repudiate
    We did not repudiate
    We did not repudiate
