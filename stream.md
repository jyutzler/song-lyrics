## The Stream of Consciousness

<pre>
<i>The stream of consciousness
The eloquence cannot be abated</i>
I was standing in my stance
You were caught in a trance
It was all so beautiful
Standing, eye-to-eye
It all happened so quickly

<i>The stream of consciousness
The eloquence cannot be abated</i>
I know I created an impossible
Situation for ourselves
I pushed and I pushed
Like a piledriver
Into the stream of consciousness

<i>The stream of consciousness
The eloquence cannot be abated</i>
Yeah we found another way
Except it never happened
The happenstance, there is a consequence
Projecting a single-minded direction
Into a one-way conversation

<i>The stream of consciousness
The eloquence cannot be abated</i>
<i>The stream of consciousness
The eloquence cannot be abated</i>
When you're looking at a picture
A portrait, photograph, or sculpture
<i>The stream of consciousness
The eloquence cannot be abated</i>
