## Give You Thing
    Doesn't matter what I see
    Doesn't matter what draws you to me
    Why justify my loyalty
    It just doesn't matter

    It's an unspoken thing
    You could be anyone
    I don't even know what that means
    But it just doesn't matter

- 

    I'm trying to talk to you
    I want you to hear me
    But you're not listening
    And it just doesn't matter

    But you ask nothing from me
    Do you have no use for me?
    I'm trying to make a difference
    But it just doesn't matter

    If I could give you anything
    I would give you everything (X4)
    Why am I repeating myself?
    It just doesn't matter

- 

    If I could give you anything
    I would give you everything (X2)

    I don't know what to do for you
    I can't help you reach your goals
    So I do what I can when I can
    I write you this song

    If I could give you anything
    I would give you everything (X4)
