## Heavy

There will come a time when you're alone   
And you can't face life on your own   
Negativity's ruling you   
And there is nothing you can do   

You look for light in many ways   
But nothing takes you from your daze   
It doesn't matter how hard you try   
'Cause all your thoughts just turn awry   

You look for God but He's not there   
And all your hopes just turn to air
You look yourself in the eye
Mumble, moan, bitch, and cry   

---

    Then somehow something likes a spark
    It takes you from that scary dark
    It may be just a simple thought
    That shows you all your hell's been fought
    
    Was it the album that you heard last
    That gave you that little extra blast?
    Or could it be the words a friend just said
    That brings your life back from the dead
