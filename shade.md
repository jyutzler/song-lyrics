## Shade

    Oh, to stand in the shade
    
    I spend my whole time walking
    Moving, moving forward
    Left front of right
    Right front of left
    
    My arms and legs
    Burned by sun and wind
    My hands black with tan
    And white, so dry
    The contrast, one thing stays the same
    Oh, to stand in the shade
    
    I spend my whole time walking
    Moving, moving forward
    Left front of right
    Right front of left
    
    My shirt, my shorts
    My shoes, my hat
    My only protection
    From the world outside
    Walk from shade to shade
    Oh, to stand in the shade
    
    Moving, moving forward
    Forward I walk, I walk
    
    I ask no questions
    Get no replies
    My life is to serve
    Not to wonder why
    
    Moving, moving forward
    Forward I walk, I walk
    
    Walking from shade to shade
    Oh, to stand in the shade
