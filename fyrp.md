## Fuck You Robert Pollard

    Fuck you Robert Pollard
    For taking them all away
    I'm trying to make it over here
    But you're standing in my way
   
    I hear these voices in my head
    Guiding me towards a riff
    I write the song and record it down
    And file it away

    And six months later I find it
    It's exactly the same
    On a single b-side
    Or compilation
    Or Track 3 of Disk 4 of some random bullshit side project
   
    So fuck you Robert Pollard
    For taking all the riffs
    And leaving me no way to express my self
    But by saying "fuck you" to you

    And what's worse in the time it took me 
    To write this fucking song
    You have written seven more
    Just to piss me off
   
    So fuck you Robert Pollard
    Fuck you
