## Thunderbird

    Innovation by a curious leader
    Nostalgia of his interesting past
    Transformed to a profitable pastime
    Directions for an expansion vast

    Counterparts' acceptance of such an idea
    Consideration of united ties
    Fast became a dominating power
    Despite desperate creators' cries
    *Thunderbird*
  
**Intimidation**

Overpowered by a carcinogenic afterthought

**Alienation**

Displaced by an immature augmentation

**Thunderbird**

    A contradiction of values
    Fools' robbery of natural supremacy
    Developed to a private showcase
    Hiding our treasured ability

    Arising feeling of bad emotion
    Alliances appearing in every corner
    Splitting ourselves in half
    Pulling us away from each other

**Revulsion**

Separated by a physical barrier

**Incompatiation**

Creation of a mental hatred

**Thunderbird**

---
 
There are four forces pulling people apart

Driving away a heart from a heart

**Thunderbird**

---

    Lack of decision by idiots
    Post revolving in an aimless circle
    Until its inevitable desolation
    Lest realization of the right angle

    Bicameralism is the way to doom
    Now we need a new direction
    To whittle away our naked feelings
    Restoring us to our original promition
    *Thunderbird*
