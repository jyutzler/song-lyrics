## Trust

    Who do you trust?
    Do you know?
    Your family?
    The latest date?
    Best friend, manager?
    New dude in the band?
    
    Find out, what have you got
    Without a friend
    It's you against the world
    Fat chance
    Do you trust yourself?
    Friends will help you
    
    Learn who they are
    It's the only way
    I have always been here
    You can trust me
    Now you know
    Make use of potential
    That's what it's there for
    
    Are you confused?
    Join the club
    Can you explain?
    Account for pain?
    Describe yourself?
    Understand me?
    Anything to tell?
    
    Slaved by feelings
    Can't let it out?
    Look to your left
    Is that all you got?
    Fat chance
    Feel better now?
    Now look to your left!
    
    Pick a topic
    That you can't explain
    A strange emotion
    A new experience
    A major screwup
    Now how do I feel?
    We share a lot.
    
    Listen to me.
