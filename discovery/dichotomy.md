## Dichotomy

    Why are you searching?
    You'll never find it
    I'll never find it
    All that you wanted
    Lies right before you
    
    Why are you searching?
    You'll never find it
    I'll never find it 
    All of this sinning 
    Can't lead to winning
    
    Delving into the interest domain
    I find a multitude of dichotomy
    Transcending anatomy
    
    Wouldn't a chameleon be loved
    If each of its colors were all beautiful?
    The darkest and the brightest...
    
    Blue or grey or green
    Pink or red or peach
    Why settle for one
    You could have it all
    Or wander away
    
    The dichotomy
    Sides matched perfectly
    The interest domain
    My needs are many
    And met by one
    
    [???]
    
    The models they strive for perfection
    But the combinations in the packaging
    Drive souls together
    
    There is not a single attribute
    Ones imperfections are what make one perfect
    Something grabs the attention
    
    Once you were schooled in geometry
    The whole is greater than the sum of its parts
    Many people had told you
    
    The world strikes a delicate balance
    Between the presences and the absences
    Each of them duly displayed
