She subsequently rewrote the poem and published it as part of [Dark Sparkler](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062348166/dark-sparkler). In response, I wrote this poem.

## @AT
    Who died?
    I'm not Jack Klompus
    I just read another poem
    Point is
    You were there
    Not when I needed you
    But when I didn't
    
    Existentialist rant?
    Witty twaddle?
    Wry diatribe?
    Why die, tribe?
    
    We all get to choose
    My aunt can care about the ants 
    So close to the pool
    The gingerbread men they were so tasty
    The non-sequitors
    They beat the puns 2-1
    But death forfeited
    
    Sorrow isn't bringing these tears, no!
    Doldrums, doldrums, doldrums, doldrums...
    Laughter! 
    That's the new drum beating in my chest
    Until I Finnish
    Satiating the Swedish
