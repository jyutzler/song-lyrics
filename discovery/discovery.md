## Discovery

    The best songs are discovered not written
    
    We know the syntax
    We know the constraints
    We've got the requirements 
    The inputs and the outputs
    The best works are discovered not written
    
    It's all a mystery
    I can't even name these chords
    But I have found them
    And that is what wins awards
    The best notes are discovered not written
    
    Just like finding the model
    In the shopping mall
    Just like finding the model
    Of the atoms and the quarks
    It's a discovery
    And that is what we do
    Figure out the world and describe it to you

    The best songs are discovered not written
    
    We know the metaphors
    We know the cliches
    We've got the vocabulary
    The rhymes and the phrases
    The best words are discovered not written
    
    When four guys wrote Echoes
    How did they know to hit the B?
    The tinkered for hours
    It was a discovery
    The best notes are discovered not written
    
    It's all there for all to see
    Hips-to-waist ratio and A goes to B
    Or words on a page
    You don't need more examples
    It's a discovery
    And that is what we do
    Figure out the world and describe it to you

    What happens next?
    We can't anticipate
    The consequences
    The love or the hate
    It's a discovery
