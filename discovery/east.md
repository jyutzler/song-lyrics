## To The East

    Yes I'd say I miss you
    It's been so long
    Sometimes I forget
    How we ever got along
    How we ever got along
    
    We hardly think alike
    Our backgrounds are so different
    If we met just two years later
    Would we have really met?
    Would we have really cared?
    
    You offered a perspective
    That I needed at the time
    Now you are so far away
    This chasm's not a crime
    This chasm's not a crime

    Yes I'd say I miss you
    It's been so long
    Sometimes I forget
    How we ever got along
    How we ever got along
    
    I wanted to see you 
    I knew it was your big day
    You had your direction
    I went the other way
    To the East
