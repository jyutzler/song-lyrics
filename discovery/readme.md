## Discovery

I produced this album in 2009, mostly drawing from songs written that decade but some significantly older. 

#### Side One
1. [Out of Bed](outofbed.md)
2. [Give You Thing](gyt.md)
3. [Dichotomy](dichotomy.md)
4. [Trust](trust.md)

#### Side Two
1. [Geas](geas.md)
2. Falling Into Thirds (instrumental)
3. [Your Kind of Winter](winter.md)
4. [Phone Talker](phone.md)
5. [Discovery](discovery.md)

If I had it to do over, I'd use this running order, incorporating some songs from 2009-10.

#### Side One
1. [Discovery](discovery.md)
2. [Give You Thing](gyt.md)
