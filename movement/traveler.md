## Traveler

    As I look at your face from afar
    What meaning and beauty I find
    The radiance you give forth
    Shifts my mind to another dimension
    Where I am a traveler
    Searching for truth in a distant kingdom
    And your face is the world that surrounds me
    
    Your eyes are the suns that bring life to this life
    And their colors the sky they created
    Your irises blue like a summer morning
    Partially grayed by the lifting haze
    And your pupils black like a fall midnight
    Without the stars or the moon to impure
    And bordering shades of read and violet
    As if they were the sight
    Of the horizon during dusk and dawn
    And these images are molded together
    Into the one world I see
    
    Your mind is the god that rules this world
    And your mouth is the Mount Olympus
    Where it is dangerous to go
    But how so many would love to
    If they could and they had no fear
    How I try but my power's too small
    My meekness, your presence halt me

    Your lips are the guardian of the mountain
    And the messenger of the god
    Standing motionless like a model
    Painstakingly quiet to all but too few
    Seemingly impossible to get into
    But there is a way to get closer
    There is a way, I know
    
    Your smile so rare and so beautiful
    Transforms the mind of the traveler
    I see a rainbow instead of a passing shower
    And the rainbow builds up a hope inside me
    That I will find what I'm looking for 
    And the truth is so wonderful
    And your face holds all of the answers
