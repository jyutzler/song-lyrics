## Written

    You're sitting alone in your room
    Pen, paper and nothing to do
    But what do you really feel?
    There's really only one thing on your mind
    The girl you met the other day
    Has captured your soul in every way
    You hope that she will make your day
    _This song will never be written_

    You tell yourself that you love her
    Your heartbeat jumps as she passes by
    You stare at her hair and you look in her eye
    She's talking to him and it feels like murder
    You pray to God she will come to you
    She sees you there and she smiles back too
    You wrack your brain for something to do
    _This song will never be written_

    Sitting alone in your room
    Scratching your paper with graphite
    You just want her to be with you
    You pick up your acoustic guitar
    And strum an interesting riff
    You feel like it is all coming together
    The words will never come out right
    Your emotions are taking over
    This song you know it has to have bite
    _This song will never be written_
 
    You're thinking about her
    You picture your face in her mind
    You feel the warmth that she radiates
    You try and pick up the phone
    But you have nothing to say
    And you leave it off the hook
    And pick up the old guitar
    _This song will never be written_
    
    You see someone walking by
    You feel the energy in her stride
    Your eyes are captured with beauty, in awe
    Just that look and you know it's her
    You're designing the song in your mind
    You finally got all the chord changes right
    You know it's going to be a hit
    _This song will never be written_
