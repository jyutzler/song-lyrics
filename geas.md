## Geas

    Moving past the last plateau
    Exceeding the expectations
    Achieving more than those before
    Changing the nature of the situation
    
    I feel the weight upon me
    Begging me to accomplish more
    Overcome regardless of excuses
    Obstacles only in the mind
    
    How does one compete
    With hundreds with the same goal?
    And if I approach your aspirations
    At what point do you extol?
    
    What is it that you really want?
    To have the best statistic?
    Or to perpetuate the madness?
    Realize its goal and why you seek it
    
    I feel the weight upon me
    Not driving me forward but dragging me to the ground
    And if I reach my destination
    Will I know what I have found?
    
    I feel the weight upon me
    Gripping me to the core
    My quest for something intangible
    My life should mean more
