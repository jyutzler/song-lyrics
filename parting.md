## Parting

<pre>
<i>Is this feeling gonna die?</i>
As I sit in my room
By an open window 
Thinking only of you 
<i>Is this feeling gonna die?</i>
I don't need the television
I can entertain myself
Doesn't matter how I try
<i>Is this feeling gonna die?</i>
I know I understand
Why we cannot be apart
Why we cannot be together
<i>Is this feeling gonna die?</i>
Miles and miles away
Oh what else can I say
But I'm not there for you?
</pre>

<pre>
<i>Is this feeling gonna die?</i>
Sometimes you look so beautiful
Sometimes I cannot see
And I can't make up my mind
<i>Is this feeling gonna die?</i>
Emptiness – no thought surround me
And the crickets listen on
And the jet plane passes by
<i>Is this feeling gonna die?</i>
After the parting
<i>Is this feeling gonna die?</i>
</pre>
