## Thunderbird

    Innovation by a curious leader
    Nostalgia of his interesting past
    Transformed to a profitable pastime
    Directions for an expansion vast

    Counterparts' acceptance of such an idea
    Consideration of united ties
    Fast became a dominating power
    Despite desperate creators' cries
    They formed a tribe
  
    A contradiction of values
    Fools' robbery of natural supremacy
    Developed to a private showcase
    Hiding our treasured ability

    Arising feeling of bad emotion
    Alliances appearing in every corner
    Splitting ourselves in half
    Pulling us away from each other
    They were a tribe

    Lack of decision by idiots
    Post revolving in an aimless circle
    Until its inevitable desolation
    Lest realization of the right angle

    Tribalism is the way to doom
    Now we need a new direction
    To whittle away our naked feelings
    Restoring us to our original promition
    Dismantle the tribe
